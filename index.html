                <p>I received a job offer mid-course, and subjects I learned were current,if not more so,in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.</p>
                <p>"I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly theafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've sucessfully switched carrers, working as a Software Enginner at a VR startup. "</p>

            <p>Awesome teaching support from T As who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance form them and learning from their experiences whas easy.</p>
            <p>"The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me confidance necessary to be ablre to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior developer. The standart is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need form an incredible community of smart and amazing people"</p>

        <p>Such a life-changing exerience. Highly recommended!</p>
        <p>"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure form professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to  the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"</p>
