                                        The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I've sucessfully switched carrers, working as a Software Enginner at a VR startup. "</p>

                    <p class="pe-5 pb-2 txt_kira2">"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed
                        some structure form professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged
                        to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The
                        entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long
                        for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the
                        next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during
                        interviews as an example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a
                        full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"</p>
